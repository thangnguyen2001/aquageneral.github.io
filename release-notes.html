Note that applying the changes is still relatively slow due the way Unity currently works, and that the Mould tool is only partially multithreaded.</li><li>All tools are now multithreaded, yielding up to a 98% core count scaling, while smoothing has up to a 90% core count scaling rate. With a quad-core Intel Core i7 6700K, Raise/Lower is up to ~3.94x faster, smoothing is now ~3.59x faster.</li><li>The default falloff for the Smooth and Mould tools have been adjusted to make them work faster.</li><li>The default brush colour's alpha value is a little more transparent than before (170 down to 155).</li><li>Change Smooth's "Smooth Radius" UI to indicate it's true size (which is <code>radius * 2 + 1</code>)</li><li>Added smooth size to the Mould tool.</li><li>Renamed the Mould tools' "Raycast Offset" parameter to "Height Offset".</li><li>Brush falloff creation is now 4x quicker.</li><li>Double clicking on an empty area in the Textures area in Paint Texture mode is now a shortcut for adding a texture.</li><li>Changed the "Alpha" parameter for brush falloff to be by default, and in place it's now called "Invert" and can be applied to procedural brushes.</li><li>Lots of internal code cleanup.</li></ul></div><div class="fixes"><h4>Fixes</h4><ul><li>Fixed "Offset Height" in the Heightmap tab not working on a terrain grid correctly.</li><li>Fixed a bug where Create Terrain Grid wasn't prompting for files that will be overwritten.</li><li>Fixed an exception when there is only one terrain as a child and there is a Terrain Former component attached the parent object.</li><li>Fixed a stutter noticable when editing a terrain grid where each and every terrain was told to update their state after using a tool even though they didn't actually change.</li></ul></div></div><div class="release"><h3>1.6.0 - <span class="date">6th of August, 2017</span><span class="unityVersion">Unity 5.3 and newer.</span></h3><div class="features"><h4>Features</h4><ul><li>Shrinkwrap tool - moulds the terrain around any 3D Physics collider in the scene - particularly useful for making the terrain around roads and paths the same height.</li><li>Height Offset in the Heightfield tab, which offsets the entire heightmap(s) by the accompinying value.</li><li>Export heightmap as an EXR (available in Unity 2017.1 and later).</li><li>Choose which axis the linear ramp generator runs along.</li><li>Framing (with the shortcut key "F") now longer is relying on the Terrain inspectors' implementation, and works across terrain grid.</li><li>Perlin noise brush.</li></ul></div><div class="improvements"><h4>Improvements</h4><ul><li>Centered the Flatten icon's arrow.</li></ul></div><div class="fixes"><h4>Fixes</h4><ul><li>Complete support for having multiple "Inspector" tabs opened at once while Terrain Former is active.</li><li>Fixed an issue where Initialize was being called twice on changing mode for the first time after OnEnable was called.</li><li>Pressing the shortcut keys to change the brush angle would result in jitter as they go past the minimum and maximum values and then clamped a frame later.</li><li>Fixed an issue where the brush projector was flipped around in a strange way.</li><li>The top projector plane visible in Flatten and Set Height tools wasn't being rotated based on the current brush angle.</li><li>If Unity will automatically show tooltips on toolbars (in Unity 2017.1 and above), it will no longer double up on tooltips and show Terrain Former's custom tooltip.</li><li>The tooltips that appear when hovering over the toolbar are no longer cutoff at low widths and behave more responsively.</li><li>Fixed an issue where Terrain Former would think the left mouse button is still pressed down when it isn't.</li><li>Fixed multiple bugs related to opening the edit/add texture window (found in the Paint Texture tool), and the window updating to add/edit states.</li><li>Vast under-the-hood script improvements.
